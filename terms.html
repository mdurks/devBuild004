            <p>What information do we collect about you?</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Authorisation and Regulation</h3>

            <p>Kitts Wealth Management are an appointed representative of Sterling Green which is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.</p>

            <p>Sterling Green the principal permitted business is advising, arranging (bringing about) transactions in home purchase plans, home reversion plans, investments, P2P agreements, pension transfers, pension opt outs, regulated mortgages, consumer buy to lets, business buy to lets and non-investment insurances.</p>

            <p>You can check this on the Financial Services Register by visiting the FCA’s website <a href="www.fca.org.uk/register">www.fca.org.uk/register</a> or by contacting the FCA on <a href="tel:08001116768">0800 111 6768</a>.</p>

            <p>Kitts Wealth Management offers restricted investment advice. This means that we have chosen to limit the range of products and/or providers that we’ll consider before recommending a suitable solution for you. In our case:</p>

            <p>We have chosen not to provide advice on certain types of investment because we believe that for the majority of our clients they are unlikely to be suitable. We have therefore focused on providing advice in the area of retirement planning and pension provisions. We also provide advice on the following investments.</p>

            <p>ISA, Open End Investment Companies (OEICs), Unit Trust and Investment Bonds.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Client Classification</h3>

            <p>We treat all our clients as “Retail Clients” unless you request otherwise. This means you are provided with the highest level of protection under the regulatory system and should have the right to take any complaint to the Financial Ombudsman Service.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Communications</h3>

            <p>We will communicate with you through a number of outlets including post, telephone and email. Where we verbally agree any course of action with you we will confirm your instruction back to you in writing before executing a transaction.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Language</h3>

            <p>We will always communicate with you in English.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Our Recommendations</h3>

            <p>Before providing advice we’ll assess your needs, consider your financial objectives and assess your attitude to any risks that may be involved. If you don’t want to discuss a particular area of financial planning and that area should not form part of the advice given, we can exclude it, if you instruct us to do so. This might of course have a bearing on the advice that might have been given.</p>

            <p>Before making any recommendations we’ll carry out a suitability assessment so that we are able to act in your best interests.</p>

            <p>We’ll confirm any recommendations we make in writing (our suitability report) along with details of any special risks that may be associated with the products or investment strategies we’ve recommended. Where we agree to provide you with a service that includes an ongoing review of the suitability of the investments we have recommended, we’ll carry out this review at least annually. To do this we will need to make contact with you to assess whether the information we hold about you remains accurate and up to date. We’ll issue you with a report setting out the results of our assessment and, if relevant, any updated recommendations.</p>

            <p>Please be aware that investments can fall, as well as rise, and that you may not get back the full amount invested. The price of investments we may recommend may depend on fluctuations in the financial markets, or other economic factors, which are outside our control. Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Conflicts of Interest</h3>

            <p>We will always act honestly, fairly and professionally when conducting business with you.</p>

            <p>We will make you aware of the existence of any conflict of interest that we are aware of, which arises between the work we are doing for you and any of our other clients or ourselves, and obtain your consent to continue before we carry out your instructions.</p>

            <p>We will take all reasonable steps to prevent conflicts of interest and to ensure your fair treatment where one does arise. A copy of our conflict of interest policy is available upon request.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Compensation Information</h3>

            <p>We meet the requirements of the FCA rules regarding financial resources, including provisions regarding holding and maintaining appropriate professional indemnity insurance.</p>

            <p>We are also covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS). You may be entitled to compensation from the scheme if we cannot meet our obligations. The value of this compensation depends on the type of business and the circumstances of the claim, as follows:</p>

            <p>Investment - Most types of investment are covered up to a maximum limit of £50,000.</p>

            <p>Insurance - Insurance advising and arranging is covered for 90% of the claim without any upper limit. For compulsory classes of insurance, insurance advising and arranging is covered for 100% of the claim, without any upper limit.</p>

            <p>Deposits - Deposits made by private individuals and small businesses to any authorised firms (retail deposits), are covered up to £85,000 per person, per authorised institution.</p>

            <p>Further information about compensation scheme arrangements is available from the FSCS at <a href="www.fscs.org.uk">www.fscs.org.uk</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Client Money</h3>

            <p>We do not have the authority to hold client money and do not operate a client account for the receipt and payment of client money in respect of investment transactions. All client money should be paid to the product provider concerned.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Best Execution</h3>

            <p>Where we send investment applications on your behalf to third parties (e.g. to put an investment into force), we’ll take all sufficient steps to ensure that we obtain the best possible result for you. This is referred to as ‘best execution’.</p>

            <p>We have a best execution policy. If you want to see a copy of it please ask us.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Other Benefits</h3>

            <p>1. From time to time we may receive other benefits from institutions that we introduce a customer to. These other benefits can be in the form of monetary or non-monetary benefits and are intended to enhance the service we can provide to our clients.  We agree to provide you with details of any monetary or non-monetary benefit received in relation to any transaction completed for you upon request.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Transfer of rights and obligations</h3>

            <p>It is agreed by both parties that the rights and obligations contained within this agreement can be transferred to our successors or another regulated firm where, (for whatever reason), we are prevented from exercising our rights and obligations with you under this agreement. We will inform you in writing of any proposed enactment of this clause.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Law and Jurisdiction</h3>

            <p>You agree that this agreement shall be governed and shall be construed in accordance with English Law, and that the parties shall submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English Courts in the event that any dispute cannot be settled under the Disputes Resolution term.</p>

            <p>We are obliged to put in place controls to prevent our business from being used for money laundering and other forms of financial crime.</p>

            <p>We’ll verify your identity before undertaking any business with you. To do this we may use electronic identity verification systems and we may conduct these checks from time to time throughout our relationship, not just at the beginning. The check may leave a ‘footprint’ on your credit file but it will not affect your credit rating.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">What happens if things go wrong</h3>

            <p>If you are unhappy with our advice or any aspect of our services, we encourage you to contact us as soon as possible. We’ll do our best to resolve your concerns.</p>

            <p>
                Daniel Shread,
                <br>Kitts Wealth Management,
                <br>Grosvenor House,
                <br>3 Chapel street,
                <br>Congleton,
                <br>CW12 4AB
            </p>

            <p>We have a complaints procedure and we can provide further details on request. If you do have a complaint, and you are not happy with our response, the Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) may be able to help. The FOS settles disputes between financial services business and their clients. Full details are available at www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Disclosure of fees/charges</h3>

            <p>All charges/fees will be fully disclosed to you. This will be disclosed in an aggregated format summary form before we undertake and work for you. The precise charges relating to any work or recommendations will be confirmed and broken down in an aggregate format within your suitability report. This charges will be shown as a percentage and monetary amount..</p>

            <p>During the review stage and presentation of advice there will be no charge implemented. If you decide to go ahead with any recommendations made, then a fee will be charged. The charge can be paid personally or taken from the value of your investment on implementation of advice</p>

            <p>Our initial fee structure is as follows;</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="bullet--disc">Initial adviser fee- up to 3% of the value on funds over the amount of £15,000</li>
                <li class="bullet--disc">Minimum fee- for fund values under £15,000 the we will operate a minimum initial charge of £450</li>
                <li class="bullet--disc">Maximum fee- the maximum fee we will charge on any advice is £9,995</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you were therefore to invest the following funds your initial charges would typically be as follows:</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="bullet--disc">If you were to invest £10,000 our minimum fee of £450 would apply</li>
                <li class="bullet--disc">If you were to invest £35,000 our fee would represent 3% of the of the value of the investment and would equate to a charge of £1,050.00</li>
                <li class="bullet--disc">If you were to invest £350,000 our fee would be capped at our maximum fee of £9,995.</li>
                <li class="bullet--disc">These charges will typically be applied and deducted from your investment on the acceptance of advice.</li>
                <li class="bullet--disc">Therefore if your fund value is in the region of £30,000 this would equate to an annual charge of £225 per annum.</li>
                <li class="bullet--disc">If the investment of your investment were to increase to £40,000, the fee would equate to a payment of £300.00</li>
                <li class="bullet--disc">Also if the investment of your investment was to reduce to £20,000, this would again equate to a fee of £150.00</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The ongoing annual advice will cover:</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="bullet--disc">Assessment of personal circumstances</li>
                <li class="bullet--disc">Review of goals & Objectives</li>
                <li class="bullet--disc">Review of investment performance & Holdings</li>
                <li class="bullet--disc">Valuations and investment commentary</li>
                <li class="bullet--disc">Reassessment of Risk profile & asset allocation</li>
                <li class="bullet--disc">Fund Switching and rebalancing if appropriate</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A report from the firm outlining the above and the fees that have been paid within the preceding 12 months.</p>

            <p>Ongoing advice can be cancelled at any time by simply informing us in writing. Please note that we reserve the right to charge you for services provided prior to cancellation</p>

            <p>If you do not select the option for the on-going services no charges will be taken from Kitts Wealth Management but a review can be provided upon request for a one off fee of £250.00.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Financial Crime</h3>

            <p>We are obliged to put in place controls to prevent our business from being used for money laundering and other forms of financial crime.</p>

            <p>We will verify your identity before undertaking any business with you. To do this we may use electronic identity verification systems and we may conduct these checks from time to time throughout our relationship, not just at the beginning. The check may leave a ‘footprint’ on your credit file but it will not affect your credit rating.</p>
