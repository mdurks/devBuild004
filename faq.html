            <h2 class="hd_secondary fs_secondary mar_btm_med bold">FAQs</h2>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">How long does the assessment process take?</h3>
            <p>It differs depending on which provider your pension is with but to review a pension takes on average 3-4 weeks as we are dependent on providers getting back to us. You can contact us at any time for an update.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">How long will it take to transfer my pension?</h3>
            <p>If you decide you want to transfer your existing pension to a different provider following your advice call, it can take an average of 4 weeks.  However, some pension providers are slower than others when completing this process.  Again, you can contact us at any time for an update.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Do you charge a fee?</h3>
            <p>We only charge a fee if you decide to take our advice and move your pension. This would be taken from your pension pot. We only recommend a switch if it is in your best interest - this is called 'best advice'. We will ensure this is cost effective for you - taking any charges into account.  There is no obligation to switch following advice. Please refer to our <a href="fees.html">Fees</a> page for a comprehensive outline of all of our fees.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">How long will my Tax-Free Cash take?</h3>
            <p>Each provider is different. We can give you a rough idea of service level agreements for your individual provider when we help you with this and we can check the progress of your case at any time.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">My provider has said that I need to speak to you about taking my 25% tax free cash?</h3>
            <p>It is best to speak to one of our pension advisers to ensure that taking your tax-free cash is the best option for you.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Why has my provider sent out transfer documents?</h3>
            <p>Some pension providers send out these documents as part of their process when they receive the Letter of Authority. We will never transfer your pension without having your permission after you have had a pension assessment and suitability report from our qualified advisers.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Are you regulated?</h3>
            <p>Kitts Wealth Management FCA number: 811832</p>
            <p>We are an appointed representative of Sterling Green Limited who are authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority - FCA number: 469956</p>
