            <p>Kitts Wealth Management is an FCA Regulated Firm and this privacy notice explains how we use any personal information we collect about you.</p>


            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">What information do we collect about you?</h3>

            <p>We collect information about you when you engage us for financial planning and advice as well as mortgage and protection advice. This information will relate to your personal and financial circumstances. It may also include special categories of personal data such as data about your health, if this is necessary for the provision of our services.</p>

            <p>We may also collect information when you voluntarily complete client surveys or provide feedback to us.</p>

            <p>Information relating to usage of our website is collected using cookies. These are text files placed on your computer to collect standard internet log information and visitor behaviour information. We’ll use your information collected from the website to personalise your repeat visits to the site</p>


            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Why do we need to collect and use your personal data?</h3>

            <p>The primary legal basis that we intend to use for the processing of your data is for the performance of our contract with you. The information that we collect about you is essential for us to be able to carry out the services that you require from us effectively. Without collecting your personal data we’d also be unable to fulfil our legal and regulatory obligations.</p>

            <p>Where special category data is required we’ll obtain your explicit consent in order to collect and process this information.</p>


            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">How will we use the information about you?</h3>

            <p>We collect information about you in order to provide you with the services for which you engage us.</p>


            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">Who might we share your information with?</h3>

            <p>If you agree, we may email you about other products or services that we think may be of interest to you.</p>

            <p>We won’t share your information for marketing purposes with any other companies outside of the firm.</p>

            <p>In order to deliver our services to you effectively we may send your details to third parties such as those that we engage for professional compliance, accountancy or legal services as well as product and platform providers and life offices that we use to arrange financial products for you.</p>

            <p>Where third parties are involved in processing your data we’ll have a contract in place with them to ensure that the nature and purpose of the processing is clear, that they are subject to a duty of confidence in processing your data and that they’ll only act in accordance with our written instructions.</p>

            <p>Where it’s necessary for your personal data to be forwarded to a third party we’ll use appropriate security measures to protect your personal data in transit.</p>

            <h3 class="hd_secondary fs_tertiary cm_secondary bold">How long do we keep hold of your information?</h3>

            <p>In principle, your personal data shouldn’t be held for longer than is required under the terms of our contract for services with you. However, we’re subject to regulatory requirements to retain data for specified minimum periods. We also reserve the right to retain data for longer than this due to the possibility that it may be required to defend a future claim against us. In any case, we’ll not retain your personal data for longer than 5 years from the end of our regulatory obligations to retain the data.</p>

            <p>You have the right to request deletion of your personal data. We’ll comply with this request, subject to the restrictions of our regulatory obligations and legitimate interests as noted above.</p>

            <p>When your personal data is processed by automated means you have the right to ask us to move your personal data to another organisation for their use.</p>

            <p>We have an obligation to ensure that your personal information is accurate and up to date. Please ask us to correct or remove any information that you think is incorrect.</p>
